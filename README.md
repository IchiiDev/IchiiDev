# IchiiDev
Hi, I'm Ichii, french self taught student for programing languages such as Java & JavaScript. Currently contributor to the [Discord FR](https://github.com/discordfr) & [WyvernTeam](https://github.com/WyvernTeam) organizations, I'm working on Minecraft plugins, Discord bots and NPM Packages on my free time. I'm not a good designer so I am building all of my skills around back-end dev for the moment and thats what I'm actively learning.
