# IchiiDev
Hi, I'm Ichii, french self taught student for programing languages such as Java & JavaScript. Currently contributor to the [Discord FR](https://github.com/discordfr), [Entasia](https://github.com/EntasiaOfficiel) & [WyvernTeam](https://github.com/WyvernTeam) organizations, I'm working on Minecraft plugins and Discord bots on my free time. I'm not a good designer so I base all of my skills on back-end dev for the moment and thats what I'm actively learning.

## Experiences
I tried some time ago to work on Python projects and I loved to make theses (Unfortunately I had so much shame with theses codes that I deleted them). But then I searched for more advanced things to do and Python was not a language that I'd use for theses projects. So I started learning JavaScript with Node.JS to make Discord Bots, then I made my big project [Wyvern](https://github.com/WyvernTeam) that is a developement team making lots of tools and bots for Discord. And Finally I started learning Java and made some projects like [SCP_Terminal](https://github.com/IchiiSama/SCP_Terminal) and Minecraft Plugins for [Entasia](https://github.com/EntasiaOfficiel).

## Thanks
I'd like to say a huge thank you to some people who helped me on internet, when I was facing an army of bugs on my projects. First [iTrooz_](https://github.com/iTrooz) he was here when I started making things on Python (that was pretty lame), he helped me starting Java & even JavaScript (And also fixed many times my VPS ❤️). Next we have [Zallom](https://github.com/Zallom) working with me on Node.JS projects from [Wyvern](https://github.com/WyvernTeam), and also letting me use his code template to kickstart bots.
